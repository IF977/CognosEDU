#Project motivation
  Education is a important need in a society, through it is possible to generate people more aware of their role as citizens, as well to encourage them to act in roles in the society that will enrich the environment which they are included , both financially and the intelectual/cultural level.
  Over time were created techniques, methodologies and teaching models in order to optimize and adapt the education in the different context in wich it operates, nowdays it’s  a very disseminated and improved theme, although not plenty exploited in some education institutions.
  As a result of it, several tools are created and sold to these instituitions with the objective of improve the learning capabilities of their students, but the results are just the opposite, and these tools became just barriers, a good learning tool must, before showing that the user is wrong, show him how to fix it.	
  Under these circumstances, we present the CognosEDU, a distance education system aimed to Middle and High school students, which has the objective of effectively advance the learning capabilities and solidify the essencial knowledge of these students.
 Much more than simply give information for someone,hoping somehow he learn it , we believe that the way which that information is passed is crucial, thus CognosEDU cannot be seen as a simply university entrance exam preparatory course, we aim to create something constant in   students' life, that more then teach has to serve as support to them and the school

#Mensurable goals of this project 
Global: To deliver an educational system capable of managing students grades in questionnaires and quizzes, tagging, and ranking the student's performances.

List of deliverable systems:

- A user management system able of creating, selecting, editing, and deleting a user. Furthermore it also must remember the user's password, allow the log in and log out operations.

- A questionnaire management system capable of creating, editing, deleting, and selecting a questionnaire, made of questions (of course). A question of the generated questionnaire must be of one of the following types:
  - question with multiple choice, without multiple selection
  - question with multiple choice, with multiple selection
  - question with descriptive answer

- A class visualization system that allows the user to watch a tutorial and links the tutorial to a questionnaire.

- A questionnaire execution system capable of viewing a list of available questions in a given time. The questionnaire execution system must also correct the user's answers. The overall process output must be the grade of the user on a given questionnaire and their grade on each question.

- A ranking system that compares the user's grades on the various questionnaires and put them in a descendant order.


#High level requirements
- Keep an online educational system that offers

- A user management system able of creating, selecting, editing, and deleting a user. Furthermore it also must remember the user's password, allow the log in and log out operations.

- A questionnaire management system capable of creating, editing, deleting, and selecting a questionnaire, made of questions (of course). A question of the generated questionnaire must be of one of the following types:
  - question with multiple choice, without multiple selection
  - question with multiple choice, with multiple selection
  - question with descriptive answer

-  A class visualization system that allows the user to watch a tutorial and links the tutorial to a questionnaire.

- A questionnaire execution system capable of viewing a list of available questions in a given time. The questionnaire execution system must also correct the user's answers. The overall process output must be the grade of the user on a given questionnaire and their grade on each question.

- A ranking system that compares the user's grades on the various questionnaires and put them in a descendant order.

- Available online 24/7.
- Provides a good user experience on using the system through the application of animations and dynamic selection using JQuery, HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap on the front-end.
- Identify the user's weaknesses and strengths through mapping the user's into categories according to the question's specifications.


#Premises
- The system must be delivered on the defined scheduled date.
- The project will be available only to the development team, monitors, and the discipline professor.
- The project will be available only for the discipline purposes and is not an open source software, therefore it must be deleted from the university repository after the conclusion of the discipline activities.
- The ownership of the project is only of the development team (Victor Hugo Barbosa Arruda, Marcos Vinícios da Silva Arcanjo and Diego Marcolino Silva), therefore they're the only ones allowed to make any sort of commercial use of it.
- The project members can exchange activities, but the project manager must be informed before the change happen.


#Restrictions
- The project must be finished until 06/30/2015.
- The team must not receive new members.
- The initial storage limit on the cloud server is 30Gb.
- The back-end system must be programmed in Ruby on Rails.
- The front-end must be written using JQuery, HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap.
- The back-end development system is going to be implemented on the Cloud9 platform.

#High level risks
- Lack of expertise of the development team. Possible difficulties on the system development. It can be solved with a better preparation of the team members to the system's implementation. Prob: Medium, Level: High.
- Lack of knowledge and know how on project management. It can result on lack of organization during the project development whether for the lack of expertise of the manager or the team members. Prob: Medium, Level: High.
Possible changes on the project scope. A few changes can happen in case a new idea arise. The closer to the original scope the better. Prob: Low, Level: Medium.
- Lack of availability of the team members. In a few cases, problems on the team's meetings can occur because of health issues or another activity outside of the project. In a case of absence, the meeting will happen with the available team members or will be reschedule.
- Difficulty of realization of a specific task. There is the possibility of team members have some difficulty with the tasks that were assigned to them, the ideal solution will be looking for someone with the knowledge to help that person. Prob: Medium, Level: High.
- Lack of motivation of the team members. There is the possibility of lack of motivation among the team, because the members may not understand the project goal, or not every member agree with the project idea. The solution would be trying to identify the members that present the undesirable behavior and involve them on the project in a different way. Prob:Low, Level:Low.
- Lack of time for the project tasks realization. It can happen because of difficulties that may make a member expend more time on a task than the necessary or because the member doesn't have time for the project's activities.

#List of stakeholders
- Professors are the ones that are going to publish their classes on our system, students are the individuals that are going to sign up and watch the classes online, both of them are the main stakeholders of this project.
- The Software Engineering teacher, professor "Vinícius Cardoso Garcia" is also a stakeholder of this project.
